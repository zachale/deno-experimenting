### What is this?

- A visual programming tool with nodes that can be generated using LLMs

### Why did I make this?

- To explore the viability of abstracting programming languages behind a generative layer
- To determine if current LLMs can reliably generate snippets of code with little to no human intervention

### Tech

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) -> plug and play local LLM prompting tool
- [LiteGraph](https://github.com/jagenjo/litegraph.js/) -> super light, vanilla javascript functional node library
- [Deno](https://deno.com/) -> lightning-fast, rust-based, JavaScript runtime environment
